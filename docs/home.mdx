# What is it about?

Hello, I'm Tema. In this documentation, I will save all my experience in programming backend applications. 
I mainly use NestJS and most of the articles are related to this framework, but there are also many useful architectural solutions that can be used in any programming language.

## Tiny Budgie

Tiny Budgie is an organization where I collect useful packages, boilerplates and docs. Feel free to contribute or contact me
