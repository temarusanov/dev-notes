# Installation

:::caution

My plan is to create command like `npx create-tema-workspace` that will automatically clone project and do all necessary stuff.
But for now, you need to do all manually.

:::



### Clone project from Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temarusanov/nx
```

### Remove external libraries. 

:::info
Workspace contains all my external libraries (`libs/external`) that were published to npm registry. 
You don't need them, because they had already been installed in this workspace, so feel free to delete this directory
:::

```bash
rm -rf libs/external
```

### Change Nx cloud access token


```json title="nx.json"
"tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
        "runner": "nx-cloud",
        "options": {
            "accessToken": "your-token-here"
        }
    }
}
```
